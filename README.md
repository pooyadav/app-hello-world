# databox app-hello-world
A simple python app-hello-world which runs in the  Databox.

When an app is installed from the Databox UI, this passes the request to  the databox container manager (CM), which installs the app. CM reads the SLA associated with the app and set the following Environment Variables:
```
DATABOX_ARBITER_ENDPOINT
DATABOX_LOCAL_NAME
DATABOX_STORE_ENDPOINT
DATABOX_ROOT_CA
Localcontainername_PEM
Localcontainername.pem
Localcontainername_key=ARBITER_TOKEN
DATABOX_EXPORT_SERVICE_ENDPOINT
```
Therefore, 
1. to integrate an app as a databox app, the app needs to have access to the keys and token to access stores.
2. App requests access to a data-store by configuring it in the databox-manifest.json file - template shown below. When container manager install the app, it also launches a data-store of the requested type.
3. In a "store" of type "store-json", following APIs could be called.

```
GET - driver-hello-world-store-json/status
GET - driver-hello-world-store-json/ws
GET - driver-hello-world-store-json/sub/*
GET - driver-hello-world-store-json/unsub/*
POST - driver-hello-world-store-json/cat 

```
4. Configure and create data types - template of information which need to provide to the API.
```
 template = {	description: 'Any Driver text',
        	contentType: 'text/json',
        	vendor: 'Databox Inc.',
        	type: 'A column/row description - for example - timeline in twitter',
       		datasourceid: 'Datasourceid',
       	 	storeType: 'store-json'
	   }
```
```
databox.registerDatasource(DATABOX_STORE_ENDPOINT, template)
```
5. Then the driver writes to the data-store by composing a request - it sends arbiter key in the request. 



### Manifest template 
In the manifest, two important things to notice here are "databox-type" and "resource-requirements" - "store". When the driver is installed, a data store of type mentioned in "store" is launched.
